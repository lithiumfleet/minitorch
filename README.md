# solve requirements

python version need: 3.9 / 3.8.10
numpy: 1.22.4
torch: 1.8.0

All works well with venv :-)
> Plaase ignore the version conflict by torch and numpy, use numpy=1.22.4 is ok.

# another version?

It seems that this version is different from others...
May be I should fork another version.
> Solved, no need to change

# Current process
- [ ] task3.3
